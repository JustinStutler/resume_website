Statement of Purpose

My fascination with artificial intelligence sparked in high school (2015-2016) when I began
coding via Milton High School's programming pathway-a rare and fortunate opportunity.
Witnessing Google DeepMind's AlphaGo defeat a world Go champion was a profound
revelation of Al's potential, shattering my perceived technological limits and igniting a lasting
interest in developing such intelligent machines, decisively setting my academic and
professional trajectory.

To explore these interests, I pursued computer science at Kennesaw State University (KSU). A
transformative summer internship which turned into a contract role at MagMutual Insurance.
Despite limited initial full-stack knowledge, I quickly integrated into a professional team,
contributing meaningfully to a significant web application. This immersive experience provided a
comprehensive education in agile processes, diverse development technologies, and real-world
software practicalities.

The COVID-19 pandemic prompted my move from Georgia to Florida, and in 2022, I joined the
University of South Florida (USF) Information Science program. After debating between web
development and data science concentrations, my MagMutual experience steered me towards
Web Development Technologies. I graduated Cum Laude in May 2024 (GPA: 3.67). My Senior
Capstone involved building a full-stack PHP/MySQL application with comprehensive CRUD data
handling..

Post-graduation, observing Al-powered tools like Cursor seamlessly integrating into full-stack
workflows crystallized my desire to specialize in Al. My core interest is in leveraging Al to
modernize and enhance the software development process. The new Master of Science in Data
Intelligence (MSDI) program at USF presents the ideal opportunity to acquire the specialized
knowledge needed for this vision.

The USF MSDI program is my clear choice. The programs focus on "data synthesis, modeling
and computational skills... [to] extract intelligence...and utilize them in business decision
making" and "solving large-scale problems" directly supports my ambition to architect Al-driven
development solutions. As a USF alumnus familiar with its excellent academic environment, and
having built a strong community in Tampa over three years, continuing at USF feels like a
natural progression. I am interested in potentially combining the computational and
decision-making tracks to earn both the MSDI degree and an Al Graduate Certificate within two
years.

My primary objective is to become an Al Engineer focused on innovative Al solutions to
revolutionize the full-stack development lifecycle. I aim to contribute to a future where Al
intelligently assists in application creation. The MSDI program is the crucial catalyst to transform
my foundational interest and practical experience into specialized expertise. I am confident in
my capacity to excel and contribute valuably to the USF graduate community and the Al field.

Thank you for your consideration.
